# CIS425WordPress
This is a project with CIS 425 to build a RVSP system using Wordpress

This repo is contains the code for the Wordpress site due for extra credit from CIS 425

This is a Wordpress website used for a Wedding.

Functionality should be: 
1) Allow to input Guest data 
2) Add Guests to different Events (Ceremony, Reception, Engagement Party, Rehearsal Dinner, Bridal Shower) on a case-by-case basis 
3) Export Guest lists for each Event to Excel 
4) Allow External Users (aka Guests) to RSVP for the Event on the website 
5) Have one Welcome/Information page where I can add Event Information and some kind words to our Guests
