This is a Wordpress website used for a Wedding.
<br>
![Target Render](images/prototype.jpg);
Functionality should be:
<br> 
1) Allow to input Guest data 
<br>
2) Add Guests to different Events (Ceremony, Reception, Engagement Party, Rehearsal Dinner, Bridal Shower) on a case-by-case basis 
<br>
3) Export Guest lists for each Event to Excel 
<br>
4) Allow External Users (aka Guests) to RSVP for the Event on the website 
<br>
5) Have one Welcome/Information page where I can add Event Information and some kind words to our Guests
